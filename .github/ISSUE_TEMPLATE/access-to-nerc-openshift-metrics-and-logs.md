Please answer some questions to justify granting your team or user access to NERC OpenShift metrics and logs.

Do you need to be able to view the application/infrastructure/audit logs of the OpenShift clusters?
Do you need user access to view NERC OpenShift metrics in Grafana for certain clusters or all clusters?
Are you building a microservice to query the metrics?
Are you pulling metrics once by hand?
Are you pulling them on a schedule?
How long will you need to query the metrics?
How much data do you plan to collect?
Which metrics do you need to observe?
Also, NERC metrics data must remain in in NERC systems only. Were you planning on pulling metrics out of NERC for any reason (research data gathering, reports)?
What is your NERC OpenShift project allocation name?
